# Project-4_Clustering_Cricket-ODI-Batting-Figures-
The data set is about the batting figures of batsmen in ODI matches:  

Choosing **strike rate and average** as the two factors on which we will cluster the data.  

+ **Strike rate**: Batting strike rate (s/r) is defined for a batsman as the average number of runs scored per 100 balls faced.  
+ **Batting Average**: A player's batting average is the total number of runs they have scored divided by the number of times they have been out,  

**TEST CRICKET :**  As for as test cricket is concerned strike rate is not an issue. Test cricket is physically draining and it requires a lot of temperament and concentration. The batsman in tests should be patient and should be able to grind when the ball is doing too much.       
    
    Strike rates anywhere in the range of 45–50 is ideal in tests.  

**ODI:**  Odi has evolved so much where scores of 330 or even 350 are chased with utmost ease. The top order should be able to see off the new ball and then they can score freely. The ideal strike rate for top order would be around 85–90. Having a opener like sehwag or warner is an added advantage who could put the bowlers off guard right from the start.     
    Odi's now a days require a strong finish . So the lower middle should have a strike rate of 100 to 110.
    
    On average, a batting average of 43 – 45 can be considered a good batting average.   

**T20:**  The strike rate is more important in t20's than the other two formats.       
    
    The ideal strike rate for t20 would anywhere around 130 mark.  
    
**Questions to be answered:**   

1. Choose the number of clusters as 4. Who falls in the same cluster as Virat Kohli?  
2. Based on the clustering, choose the correct statement given that the clusters formed are (high SR, high Ave) - A, (low SR, low Ave) - B, (High SR, Low Ave) - C, (Low SR, High Ave) - D?  
3. Make the dendrogram using the complete linkage.Cut the tree at k = 4. Which of the following is correct statement?
